# Project 5: Security Security Security

## Prompt Description
By now we are on :fire:! In a good way :+1: -- We've Innersourced our repo, we have CI/CD running, Probot + GitHub Apps, a GitHub Page, and an awesome Game Name to launch with Acme. Now, we need a way to secure our application going forward and make sure it stays in top shape. 

We can leverage GitHub Security Vulnerability Alerts for this + Dependabot, to keep all of our dependencies in this repo up to date and secure. By now, you may have noticed we started this application with quite a few vulnerable dependencies. i.e. 

What can you do to make sure these are covered?
- [ ] Configuring [Security Vulnerability Alerts](https://help.github.com/en/articles/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository)
- [ ] [Enabling Dependabot](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes)
- [ ] Setting up a [Security Policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository)
- [ ] Build a [Support Policy](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-support-resources-to-your-project)

After these two pieces of infra are turned on... Dependabot will generate automatic pull requests and we'll be ready to roll!
