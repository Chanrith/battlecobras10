# Project 2: Innersourcing, The Game + GitHub Pages

## Prompt Description
You just started in your new role at Acme Engineering, and with their last wave of success from their hit multiplayer games, you've been tasked to document their most upcoming launch. You'll need to take this jumble of source code, and follow open source best practices to make it Innersourced.

You also just followed Project 1 - finishing the Innersourced fundamentals, and completing a REAME.md file, contributing files, and an Issue Templates.

Now, it's time we ship this Project to the world using a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).

What is a GitHub Page? Well check out this video below and find out!

We need to create a [project site](https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages#project-pages-sites), which you can do quickly by navigating to your repository settings page, and launching a GitHub Page from there.

Once your page is published, feel free to pick a new theme, and or customize it to your liking, congrats! The core part of Project 2 is complete, and you just launched a real website to the world.
