## Project 3: Workflow, Adding CI to the Game


## Prompt Description

One of the key benefits of using a modern version control platform is the ability to leverage continuous integration and continuous deployment. The second that someone on your team checks in code, you can kick off a set of processes and checks to run tests, lint your code, check for security vulnerabilities, and much more. Once those checks have passed, you can have your code deployed to a sandbox or production environment.
* Let’s pretend that your team wanted to adopt CI/CD in the next week—what would need to happen to make that a possibility? What tests / processes would need to run? How would you architect your deployment strategy? What is the closest that you could get to making your master branch “production ready”?
